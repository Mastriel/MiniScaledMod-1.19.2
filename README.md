You can craft a scale box using nether stars, a glass block and a dye. 1 nether star gives 8x scale box, 2 nether stars gives 16x scale box, 3 nether star gives 32x scale box.

The scale boxes are discriminated by its color, size and owner. (The owner is only for discrimination, you can enter a scale box that's owned by another player)

When you are standing on the top of a scale box, press shift to descend.
